Nodepool
========

Nodepool is a service used by the OpenStack CI team to deploy and manage a pool
of devstack images on a cloud server for use in OpenStack project testing.

This is a pulp-specific fork of nodepool. To update, add the upstream remote
from https://github.com/openstack-infra/nodepool.git and pull in changes from
master in that repo.
